# Vision - Personal Time Management App

## üéØ Mission Statement

To create the most comprehensive and insightful personal task management application that not only helps users organize their daily tasks but also provides deep analytics into their productivity patterns, habits, and long-term behavioral trends‚Äîall while maintaining complete privacy and data ownership.

## üåü Core Philosophy

### Data as a Personal Asset
We believe that your productivity data is one of your most valuable personal assets. Every task you create, every completion, every pattern‚Äîit all tells the story of how you work, grow, and achieve your goals. This data should:
- **Belong entirely to you** - No cloud dependencies, no data sharing
- **Be preserved forever** - Even as the app evolves, your historical data remains intact
- **Generate insights** - Turn your task history into actionable productivity intelligence
- **Enable growth** - Help you understand and optimize your work patterns

### Privacy by Design
- **Local-first**: All data lives on your machine
- **Git-friendly**: Plain JSON files that work with version control
- **Transparent**: You can see, modify, and backup all your data
- **No tracking**: We don't know what tasks you create or how you use the app

## üöÄ Long-term Vision (3-5 Years)
